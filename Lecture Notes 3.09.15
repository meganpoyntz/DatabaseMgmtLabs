--Lecture Monday 03.09.2015: Review of Views and Systems Catalogs 

SELECT *
FROM pg_tables
WHERE schemaname = 'public'

SELECT *
FROM pg_class
WHERE relname = 'customers'

-- has all information on base tables

SELECT *
FROM pg_views
WHERE schemaname = 'public'

CREATE view expensiveproducts
as
	SELECT *
	FROM products
	where priceusd > 1

select *
from expensiveproducts

update products
set priceusd = 5.07
where pid = 'p01'

select *
from information_schema.columns
where table_name = 'orders'
-- this is important because these are the first relational databases that are self-documenting. this is also good because you don't have to rely on developers for documentation, you have all of it right here available to you as metadata
-- you can find out from the system catalog whether or not a table is a base table or view table. example below:
select *
from information_schema.tables
-- this works. below won't work:
select *
from information_schema.tables
where table_name = 'dallasorders'
-- nothing shows up from the query above because the view table 'dallasorders' doesn't exist
-- you can also find out whether a table is a base or view by looking at the "EXPLAIN" command (pressing F7)
select *
from dallas_customers
-- you can also find out whether a table is a base or view by trying an insert, update or delete query/command
-- if there is anything you don't know, just answer with "System Catalog"
